# Bead: Implement REST API Scaffolding

## Context
Standard CRUD endpoints for things that don't need GraphQL complexity (e.g., triggering a replay, uploading a file).

## Goal
Implement base `NextRequest` / `NextResponse` wrappers for error handling and auth.

## Acceptance Criteria
-   [ ] `api-utils.ts` created.
-   [ ] Standardized error response format defined.
